This code is taken from apultra tool:
https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/apultra/releases/tag/1.3.0

Unnecessary files for the purpose of integrating with SGDK were removed.
appack.c was rewritten into appack_compat.c for appack compatibility.

Note this uses zlib and CC0 licenses. The tool is only used for the purpose
of packing assets into game ROMs but no code is shipped in such ROMs.
